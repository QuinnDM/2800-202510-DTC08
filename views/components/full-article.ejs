    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Seasonal Bird Migration Guide</h1>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Bird migration is one of nature's most impressive phenomena. Each year, billions of birds travel thousands of miles between breeding and wintering grounds, navigating by stars, landmarks, Earth's magnetic field, and even their sense of smell.
    </p>
    
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Understanding Migration Timing</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Migration follows a predictable calendar in most regions, though exact timing can vary by species and weather conditions:
    </p>
    
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>
        <strong>Spring Migration (March-May):</strong> Birds travel north to breeding grounds. Waterbirds and raptors often lead, followed by insect-eaters like warblers and flycatchers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fall Migration (August-November):</strong> Birds travel south to wintering grounds. Generally more spread out than spring migration, with shorebirds often starting in July.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Migration Hotspots</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Certain geographic features concentrate migrating birds, making these locations excellent for observation:
    </p>
    
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>
        <strong>Coastlines:</strong> Many birds follow coastlines as navigational guides.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Ridges and Mountain Passes:</strong> Migrating raptors use thermal updrafts along ridges.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Major Waterways:</strong> Rivers provide navigation routes and rest stops.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Peninsulas and Land Bridges:</strong> Birds concentrate where land narrows.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Tips for Observing Migration</h2>
    
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>
        <strong>Time of Day:</strong> Dawn is best for songbirds; hawks often migrate mid-morning to afternoon.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Weather:</strong> Check forecasts for conditions that trigger migratory movements. Birds often move after cold fronts in fall and warm fronts in spring.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Night Migration:</strong> Many birds migrate at night. On clear nights in migration season, try watching the moon with binoculars to observe silhouettes passing by.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p class="mt-8 mb-4">
      Migration is a vulnerable time for birds. You can help by keeping cats indoors during peak migration, turning off unnecessary lights at night to prevent disorientation, and supporting habitat conservation efforts along migratory routes.

      <li>
        <strong>Practice Shorthand:</strong> Develop quick notation for common shapes and patterns.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p class="mt-8 mb-4">
      Remember that your journal is for your own use and enjoyment. There's no right or wrong way to keep one—the most important thing is consistency. A bird journal maintained over years becomes a treasured record of your growth as a birder and the changing patterns of birds in your area.

        areas attract diverse water birds.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Woodland Edges:</strong> The transition between forests
        and open areas creates diverse habitat that attracts many
        species.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Bird Watching Etiquette</h2>

    <p class="mb-4">

      <li>Observe from a distance that doesn't disturb the birds</li>
      <li>Keep noise to a minimum</li>
      <li>Stay on designated trails to avoid damaging habitat</li>
      <li>Never approach nests during breeding season</li>
      <li>

  <article id="bird-identification-article" class="px-4" style="display: none;">
    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Bird Identification Tips for Beginners</h1>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Learning to identify birds is one of the most rewarding aspects of bird watching. 
      While it may seem overwhelming at first with thousands of species worldwide, 
      focusing on a few key characteristics can make the process much simpler.
    </p>
    
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Four Keys to Bird Identification</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Professional birders often use these four main characteristics to identify birds:
    </p>
    
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>
        <strong>Size and Shape:</strong> Is the bird small like a sparrow or large like a crow? 
        Notice the proportions of the head, bill, wings, and tail.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Color Pattern:</strong> What are the main colors and where are they located? 
        Look for wing bars, eye rings, and distinctive markings.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Behavior:</strong> How does the bird move and feed? Does it walk, hop, swim, or soar? 
        Some birds bob their tails or flick their wings in characteristic ways.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Habitat:</strong> Where did you see the bird? Different species prefer specific 
        environments like forests, wetlands, grasslands, or urban areas.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Tools for Identification</h2>
    
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>
        <strong>Field Guide:</strong> A regional guide is essential for narrowing down possibilities.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Smartphone Apps:</strong> Apps like Merlin Bird ID or Audubon can help with instant identification.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Binoculars:</strong> Good optics let you see details from a distance.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Camera:</strong> Photos can help with later identification of challenging birds.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p class="mt-8 mb-4">
      Remember that even experienced birders sometimes can't identify every bird they see. 
      The process of learning is part of what makes bird watching such an engaging hobby.

  <!-- Bird Photography Article -->
  <article id="bird-photography-article" class="px-4" style="display: none;">
    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Bird Photography Fundamentals</h1>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Bird photography combines the thrill of bird watching with the creative outlet of photography. 
      Capturing these fast-moving subjects requires patience, preparation, and some specialized techniques.
    </p>
    
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Essential Equipment</h2>
    
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>
        <strong>Camera with Fast Autofocus:</strong> Birds move quickly, so a camera with good tracking capabilities is essential.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Telephoto Lens:</strong> A focal length of at least 300mm is recommended for most bird photography.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tripod or Monopod:</strong> Helps stabilize longer lenses, especially in low light.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Extra Batteries and Memory Cards:</strong> You may spend hours in the field waiting for the perfect shot.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Camera Settings for Bird Photography</h2>
    
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>
        <strong>Shutter Speed:</strong> Use at least 1/1000 second for perched birds and 1/2000 or faster for birds in flight.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Aperture:</strong> A wide aperture (f/4 to f/5.6) helps isolate the bird from the background.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>ISO:</strong> Start with the lowest possible for conditions, but don't hesitate to increase it to maintain a fast shutter speed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Drive Mode:</strong> Continuous shooting (burst mode) increases your chances of capturing the perfect moment.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Composition Tips</h2>
    
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>
        <strong>Rule of Thirds:</strong> Position the bird off-center for a more dynamic composition.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Background:</strong> Look for clean, uncluttered backgrounds that don't distract from your subject.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Eye Level:</strong> Whenever possible, photograph birds at eye level for a more intimate perspective.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Space for Movement:</strong> Leave room in the frame in the direction the bird is facing or moving.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p class="mt-8 mb-4">
      Remember that ethical bird photography puts the welfare of the birds first. 
      Never disturb nesting birds or use calls/playback to attract birds, as this can disrupt their natural behavior.
