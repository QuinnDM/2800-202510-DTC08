            Spring brings the most dramatic bird migrations of the
            year, as species return from their winter grounds.
            Colorful warblers, energetic swallows, and vocal thrushes
            fill the skies and trees.

              The best time for spring birding is typically the first

              Bring layers as spring mornings can be chilly but warm

            Summer is prime time for observing breeding behaviors,
            nesting activities, and adorable fledglings taking their
            first flights. Many species are raising their young and

              active. Watch for family groups and listen for juvenile
              birds making their distinctive begging calls.

          </h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            Fall migration is more spread out than spring, and many
            birds are in their subdued non-breeding plumage, creating
            identification challenges. This is also when many young
            birds are making their first migrations.

              Pay close attention to habitat and behavior in fall, as
              plumage can be confusing. Focus on body shape, size, and
              movement patterns to help with tough identifications of
              birds in non-breeding plumage.

          </h3>

            Winter brings northern species to more southern latitudes,
            creating opportunities to see birds that aren't present
            during other seasons. Food scarcity makes birds easier to
            attract to feeders and more visible as they actively
            search for food.

              Maintain feeders with high-energy foods like black oil
              sunflower seeds and suet. Check open water sources like
              rivers, power plant outflows, and lakes for
              concentrations of waterfowl that can't find open water
              elsewhere.
