          <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Bird Photography Fundamentals</h1>

          <p class="mb-4">
            Bird photography combines the thrill of bird watching with the
            creative outlet of photography. Capturing these fast-moving subjects
            requires patience, preparation, and some specialized techniques.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Essential Equipment</h2>

          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Camera with Fast Autofocus:</strong> Birds move quickly,
              so a camera with good tracking capabilities is essential.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Telephoto Lens:</strong> A focal length of at least 300mm
              is recommended for most bird photography.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tripod or Monopod:</strong> Helps stabilize longer lenses,
              especially in low light.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Extra Batteries and Memory Cards:</strong> You may spend
              hours in the field waiting for the perfect shot.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">
            Camera Settings for Bird Photography
          </h2>

          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Shutter Speed:</strong> Use at least 1/1000 second for
              perched birds and 1/2000 or faster for birds in flight.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Aperture:</strong> A wide aperture (f/4 to f/5.6) helps
              isolate the bird from the background.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>ISO:</strong> Start with the lowest possible for
              conditions, but don't hesitate to increase it to maintain a fast
              shutter speed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Drive Mode:</strong> Continuous shooting (burst mode)
              increases your chances of capturing the perfect moment.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Focus Mode:</strong> Continuous autofocus (AI Servo for
              Canon, AF-C for Nikon) helps track moving subjects.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Metering:</strong> Spot or center-weighted metering works
              best for birds against varied backgrounds.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Composition Tips</h2>

          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Rule of Thirds:</strong> Position the bird off-center for
              a more dynamic composition.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Background:</strong> Look for clean, uncluttered
              backgrounds that don't distract from your subject.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Eye Level:</strong> Whenever possible, photograph birds at
              eye level for a more intimate perspective.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Space for Movement:</strong> Leave room in the frame in
              the direction the bird is facing or moving.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Focus on the Eye:</strong> A sharp eye is critical in bird
              photography. If the eye isn't in focus, the entire image can feel
              off.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Field Techniques</h2>

          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Be Patient:</strong> Often the best shots come after
              waiting quietly in one spot for extended periods.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Learn Behaviors:</strong> Understanding bird behavior
              helps you anticipate action and capture interesting moments.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Use Blinds or Hides:</strong> These can help you get
              closer to birds without disturbing them.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Visit Repeatedly:</strong> Returning to the same location
              helps you learn the patterns and behaviors of local birds.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Weather Considerations:</strong> Overcast days provide
              soft, even lighting, while early morning and late afternoon offer
              golden light.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">
            Ethics in Bird Photography
          </h2>

          <p class="mb-4">Always prioritize the welfare of your subjects:</p>

          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>
              Never disturb nesting birds or use calls/playback to attract birds
            </li>
            <li>
              Maintain a respectful distance that doesn't cause stress or
              altered behavior
            </li>
            <li>Follow all rules and guidelines in protected areas</li>
            <li>
              Never disclose the locations of sensitive species or nesting sites
            </li>
            <li>
              Be honest about your images - don't use baiting or captive birds
              without disclosure
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p class="mt-8 mb-4">
            Remember that ethical bird photography puts the welfare of the birds
            first. The best images come from patience, knowledge, and respect
            for your subjects and their habitat.
